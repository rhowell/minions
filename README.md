Minions
=======
You're busy, too busy.  There are always so many enemies to vanquish and planets to conquer.  What a future emperor of the universe like you needs is minions.  Minions are great! They do what you ask without question, and if they get killed in the line of duty? Meh!  There's always another minion ready to take its place, in loyal service to you.

Minions is a Ruby gem for actor based systems.  This is my take on a distributed (multiple-machine) actor system compatible with MRI, Rubinius, & JRuby implementations.
